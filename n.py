Dear {name},

I am Aditya Kumar, a fourth-year B.Tech IT student at the Institute of Engineering and Management, Kolkata. Along with cybersecurity and malware analysis, I have practical experience working with AWS cloud services, which I believe will help me contribute effectively to your projects.

I am writing to apply for a cybersecurity internship at {company}. My experience spans malware detection, steganalysis, penetration testing, and security automation, with hands-on projects involving session hijacking detection and image-based malware analysis using Python. I’ve also worked with tools like Metasploit, Wireshark, and VirusTotal to build automated detection pipelines.

I am particularly interested in SOC operations, as well as red and blue team methodologies. I enjoy tackling new challenges and am eager to contribute to real-world defensive and offensive security projects while learning from your team.

Please find my resume attached for your review. I would be excited to bring my skills and enthusiasm to your cybersecurity efforts.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Aditya Kumar
